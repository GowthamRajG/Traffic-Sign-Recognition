Traffic Sign Recognition can be staged into two sections Traffic Sign Detection and Traffic
Sign Classification. This is one way to perceive the recognition pipeline. In Detection stage, extract possible candidates/regions which contain some traffic sign. In Classification stage, we go over each Region of Interest
(RoI) and identify what sign it represents i.e., given that a set of traffic signs are known, the code
now classifies what this specific RoI represents.
